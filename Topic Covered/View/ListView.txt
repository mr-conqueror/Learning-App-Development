Theory::::::::
ListView is a viewgroup that can display a list of scrollable items.
Widely used and very powerful component in android.
Each of the item in listview is clickable.

First of all we need data source to add data  in listView
##Listview   <- Adapter <-   data source[] (string,array,array List) 

#Adapter serves as bridge between Listview and data source.
Two adapters.
I.  Array adapter [single item]
2. base adapter [multiple item]
Adapter pulls the data from the source and convert into a view
Then set the view into ListView/GridView/Spinner

Creating a listView::::::

Firstly, create a listView;
ListView Properties:
listSelector
Divider
dividerHeight
Secondly, Add resources for ListView;
Create  resources;
Get the resources in the java class;
String [] s = getResources.getStringArray(R.array.bla);
Create a view.
The resources will be converted into a view;
Now create a adapter to store the view into ListView;
ArrayAdapter<String> obj = new ArrayAdpater<String>(this,R.layout.view,R.id.viewid,string name);
ListView.setAdapter(adapter);
